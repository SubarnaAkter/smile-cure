                                        There's no getting around the need to get around your teeth daily with dental floss. It clears food and plaque from between teeth and under the gumline. If you don't, plaque hardens into tartar, which forms wedges and widens the space between teeth and gums, causing pockets. Over time, gums pull away and teeth loosen.

                                        Either waxed or unwaxed floss will do the job. Using floss picks or interdental brushes is another easy option.

                                    <Accordion.Body>
                                        Medical and dental experts study the use of X-rays and set limits for their safety. Your dentist should take as few as possible. Sometimes dentists may recommend X-rays to diagnose a special problem. Advancements in technology means today's digital X-rays release much less radiation and are safer than in the past.

                                        Expect to get them during a first exam after not seeing a dentist for a while. This helps check tooth and gum health. If you have gum disease, the dentist may want pictures every 6 months. For regular check-ups, it's about every 2 years, depending on your dentist's plan.

                                    <Accordion.Body>
                                        Sealants protect against cavities that can form in the natural tiny holes and cracks on the outside of teeth. Kids from about 6 to 12 benefit from having sealants painted and hardened onto the chewing surfaces of their back teeth, or molars. Adults can get sealants as well to protect teeth that don't have fillings.

                                        Dentists or dental assistants put sealants on in an office visit, and it's painless. They last around 2-4 years.

                                        Stores sell many whitening products, and you can get take-home gels and trays from your dentist, but neither is as strong as procedures done in a dental office

                                        If you want to try an over-the-counter whitener, look for one with an ADA seal. Check with your dentist for advice before you buy, especially if you have dental work or dark stains. And don't keep using them, or you could damage your teeth.
